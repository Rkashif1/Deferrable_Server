## Abstract

This seminar paper presents the **Deferrable Server (DS) Algorithm**, a scheduling technique designed to improve responsiveness in real-time systems. Unlike traditional algorithms that prioritize periodic or aperiodic tasks individually, the DS algorithm serves both task types, enhancing aperiodic response times without sacrificing periodic task deadlines. Through simulation and UPPAAL modeling, this paper examines the DS algorithm's efficiency and its advantages over conventional polling and background methods. The DS algorithm demonstrates a flexible and robust approach to managing high-traffic, real-time environments, providing essential insights for modern embedded systems.

## Key Concepts

- **Deferrable Server (DS) Algorithm**: Optimizes real-time task scheduling by prioritizing aperiodic tasks until periodic deadlines are near, balancing system performance.
- **Aperiodic and Periodic Task Management**: Ensures critical tasks meet strict deadlines while improving aperiodic task response times.
- **UPPAAL Modeling**: Simulates and validates DS behavior, confirming performance gains over traditional scheduling methods.

## Highlights

- Enhanced response times for aperiodic tasks in real-time systems.
- Flexible resource allocation strategy ideal for dynamic environments.
- Simulation results underscore the DS algorithmâ€™s advantages in handling mixed task loads.

## Conclusion

The Deferrable Server Algorithm provides a dynamic solution for real-time scheduling by integrating flexibility in aperiodic task management without compromising periodic task reliability. This approach is valuable for applications requiring high responsiveness and efficient resource use.
